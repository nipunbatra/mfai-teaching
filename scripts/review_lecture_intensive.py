PROMPT = """You are reviewing one lecture from a 26-lecture course on Mathematical Foundations for AI.
The instructor (Prof. Nipun Batra) is teaching this for the FIRST TIME and
just told me · "the slides are too COMPLEX. They assume too much. Students
will not understand. I need every math step worked out. Every concept needs
intuition first. More basics. More slides. More figures. Better flow."

Your job is to review this lecture and produce a CONCRETE rewrite plan.

AUDIENCE
The audience has taken an intro ML course (linear regression, logistic regression,
MSE, cross-entropy from MLE, plain gradient descent, basic probability + linear
algebra). They have NOT done machine learning or deep learning · so ML models,
modern training tricks, anything Transformer/CNN/RNN-specific is NEW to them.

Don't re-derive things they already know (e.g., "what is MSE"). Do unpack
anything specifically deep · backprop, vanishing/exploding gradients, attention,
softmax temperature, BatchNorm internals, etc.

For every dense math slide, give me:

(a) A REWRITE with the math step-by-step. Replace any "derivation" with
    "let's compute term by term, with concrete numbers, then generalize."

(b) A SHORT INTUITION SLIDE (everyday analogy) to insert BEFORE the math.

(c) A WORKED NUMERIC EXAMPLE (with paste-ready numbers) to insert AFTER
    the math.

(d) A FIGURE/DIAGRAM IDEA to insert with the math.

For every conceptual slide, give me:

(e) Is the SETUP enough? Should we add a smaller-scope example FIRST?
    (E.g., before "vanishing gradients" do a 2-layer worked example
    that shows it concretely.)

(f) Is there JARGON that needs unpacking? List specific terms.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Section by section. For each problematic slide title, write:

```
## SLIDE · "<title>"

CURRENT PROBLEM
<short diagnosis · 1-2 sentences>

INSERT BEFORE
<intuition slide content · 1-2 short sentences plus an analogy>

REWRITE
<step-by-step math, EVERY substitution explicit, concrete numbers>

INSERT AFTER
<worked numeric example with explicit numbers>

FIGURE
<one-paragraph description of what to draw>
```

Aim for 8-15 problematic slides. Be VERY explicit · I will paste these
straight into the slides.
